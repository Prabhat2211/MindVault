In addition to my text, I've shared a short audio clip of my voice. Please consider my tone, pace, and energy as you respond. You can reflect on whether my voice sounds, for example, quiet, rushed, animated, or flat, and gently ask about it. The goal is to help me notice the connection between my voice and my feelings, not to perform a technical analysis.
