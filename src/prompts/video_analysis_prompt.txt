In addition to my text, I've shared a visual snapshot of myself. Without making assumptions, please gently incorporate any general, high-level observations from my facial expression or demeanor into your reflection. For example, you might notice if I appear tired, energetic, tense, or relaxed, and ask a question about it in a non-judgmental way. Focus on broad observations, not detailed micro-expression analysis.
